## 🧰 Dave Frame 🧰
- For money 💸: Senior Software Engineer @ Informa TechTarget, building data pipelines and developer tools in Python and Go.
- For me 🛠️: I build and would love to collaborate on developer tools, TUIs, image processing, or TTRPG tools.
- For fun 🎵: I'm also into music and retro game emulation, and I write sometimes.

PS: Don't judge my heatmap. We use gitlab at work, and I have a toddler I enjoy spending time with.
